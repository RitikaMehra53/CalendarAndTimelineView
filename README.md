## Motivation

You can find a view like this in the official Calendar app by Outlook. This kind of duration based height adjustment is difficult to implement natively without the use of a Custom View. This code does all the heavy work for you and provides a clean API to tweak the settings easily using both xml atributes as well as through code.
